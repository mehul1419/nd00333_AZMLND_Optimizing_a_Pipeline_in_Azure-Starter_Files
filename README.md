# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This project examines a given marketing dataset from banking customers in order to create a model which emulates whether or not the customer will subscribe to a term deposit at the bank.

The best performing model was generated by AutoML(VotingEnsemble) algorithm.
## Scikit-learn Pipeline
Data Preparation:
Preprocess and clean the bank marketing dataset, handling missing values and encoding categorical variables if necessary.

Feature Engineering and Splitting:
Perform feature engineering as needed and split the data into training and testing sets.

Hyperparameter Sampling:
Define a random hyperparameter sampler for Logistic Regression, specifying ranges for 'C' (regularization) and 'max_iter' (maximum iterations).

Early Stopping Policy:
Implement BanditPolicy as the early-stopping policy to terminate poorly performing runs, improving computational efficiency.

HyperDrive Configuration:
Configure HyperDrive to automate model generation using the defined estimator, hyperparameter sampler, and early-stop policy.

## AutoML

The top-performing model produced by AutoML is a Voting Ensemble. A Voting Ensemble, also known as a majority voting ensemble, combines predictions from multiple machine learning algorithms. Its purpose is to enhance accuracy and stability by leveraging the strengths of various models, particularly useful when different models excel with different types of input data.



## Pipeline comparison
Scikit-learn Pipeline - Accuracy - 91.56%
AutoML - Accuracy - 91.75%

Therefore, the AutoML pipeline out performed the Scikit-learn pipeline.

## Future work
The AutoML pipeline may be additionally improved given better resources/compute time, which in this experiment timed out at 30 minutes. Also, if we get more data for training, it would help to create the model for this use-case.
